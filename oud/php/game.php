    <h2>Game Jam 2019</h2>
    <p>
        During the last Global Game Jam I made music and sound effects for a game called Splash 'n Dash. In 48 hours me and a small team created a game about a fish trying to escape a kitchen. Because of the goofy aestetic and younger target audience I decided to make a fun, nautical themed piece of music to play during gameplay.<br>
        Have a listen to the main theme:

    <label>Background music for Splash n' Dash</label>

    <h2>Fire Tires</h2>
    <p>
        I was asked to make a menu and main theme for the game Fire Tires by TZLizard (a group of Game Design students from Sweden). The game called for a upbeat track that could be played on a show floor without getting repetative. <br> To create more variety I made a collection of short loops that would be played in a random order, together forming a main menu theme.
