            As part of audio collective <b>Thinking in Sound</b>, we made a sound installation that allows children ages 6 and under to make music in a way that is accessible to them. <br>
            The installation was presented on festivals in Haarlem and Bloemendaal

        h2 Teaching digital accessibility through an online game
    .back(style="background: #3354E0; color: var(--light)")
        p As part of an internship at <b>Stichting Accessiblity</b> I designed and developed an online game that raises awareness by letting the player experience what it's like to have a disability when using the internet. 
        p The game was created over the course of 3 months and I did the conceptualisation, design and final development of the game. 
        p Experience experts were consulted at every step in the design proces to make sure each disability was accurately depicted.
