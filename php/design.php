        I have experience designing websites, flyers, posters, bussiness cards etc.<br>
        Here are some recent examples:

    <img src="images/fortm_web.png" alt="fort-m image">
    <img src="images/fortem.jpg">
    <h2>fort&#8209;m</h2>
    <p>
        In 2018 I did the branding for fort-m, an art class tought at various forts around Utrecht.
        I made a custom font called "fortem", inspired by the typography seen on the barracks of these forts. I also
        made the website, flyers and other marketing material.

    <h2>UI Design</h2>
    <p>This is an example of a synthesiser ui design I made for a school project. The aestetic is the derived from
        modular synths with a modern twist. I tried to make different section as clear as possible by using different
        colors as the virtual synth was going to be manipulated live during a performance.</p>

    <h2>Booklet</h2>
    <p>
        This is a book I made showcasing the artworks throughout the carrier of Willem de Bruin, my father, who passed
        away in 2017.
        <br> The book was designed in InDesign and sold as a limited print.
