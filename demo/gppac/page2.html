          Through our joint effort, CECORE helps young people to change their communities. Now, many young people in Karamoja, Northern Uganda, are moving away from violence and are developing the skills to provide for their families. As young leaders, they speak out against destructive ways and embrace dialogue for peace. And with much success: the young peace champions reconcile conflicting parties, support fellow youth and speak out against violence and practices like forced marriage.

          Without a doubt, education has the ability to change lives for the better. This was the case for Khaled. Khaled was born in a small village in the poorest area of Egypt. He was brought up in a culture where violence and conflict were prominent and the use of weapons the norm. He took up education as his tool to make peace. To make a change.

        <p>Women drive conflict prevention on the ground. Every day, women build sustainable peace in their communities as educators, community mediators and advocates. Their inclusion in peacebuilding processes is, therefore, a prerequisite for long-term success. However, women and especially young women, remain excluded from peace processes. We unite in our shared commitment to redesign the table and shift the power to women peacebuilders preventing conflict at the local and regional level.</p><a href="https://gppac.net/news/redesign-table-sustainable-peace-security" target="_blank">Learn more</a>

        <h3>Local action on SDGs</h3>
        <p>
          For peacebuilders like Visaka Dharmadasa (Sri Lanka), Justine Kwachu Ngum Kumche
          (Cameroon) and Khaled Emam (Egypt), the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are an important tool. 
          <a href="https://gppac.net/news/why-integrated-implementation-sdgs-will-help-build-peaceful-societies" target="_blank">Implementing the SDGs</a> 
          is critical to strengthen conflict prevention, as an integral element of inclusive and sustainable development.
        </p>
        <p><a href="https://gppac.net/publications/peaceful-societies-orphaned-sdg-target" target="_blank">Taking the SDG framework and adjusting the goals, indicators and means of implementation to local contexts </a> 
          - is important to us. This is key to making the SDGs  successful. Our members, 
          <a href="https://gppac.net/publications/cameroon-sdg-16-cameroon-progress-towards-peaceful-just-and-inclusive-societies" target="_blank">WAA Cameroon </a> and

          conducted civil society reviews of how to localise and implement SDG 16 on peaceful and inclusive societies through a people-centered approach, highlighting the benefits of using this framework. From these reviews the importance of meaningful inclusion of women and youth came out as one of the key recommendations.

        <h3>Preventing Conflict in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)</h3>
        <p>
          All across the world, our members are working to prevent violent conflicts and build peaceful societies. Like in the DRC, where after many years of violent conflict, there are still frequent eruptions of violence. A reemerging conflict practice is kidnapping. The trend of carrying out kidnapping for ransom as a means of generating income has been on a rise in the DRC, particularly in the eastern provinces of North and South Kivu.
          <br><br>
          Our member, Heritiers de la Justice in DRC, is working on this issue. They provided communities with a toll-free number to call where they learned more about the issue, shared information and alerted authorities. This led to the arrest of several outlaws responsible for looting and hostage-taking, in the territory of Uvira in the DRC. Heritiers de la Justice made sure to continuously involve youth and women in the approach to the problem, as it is key to include all members of society. 
          <br><br>
          The work of Heritiers de la Justice was made possible thanks to the funds from our Prevention Up Front Alliance project.

        <h1>A Glimpse Past the Wall in Palestine</h1>
        <p>
          This is Walaa, a young Palestinian woman who lives in a refugee camp next to an Israeli checkpoint. Every day, Walaa is faced with separation in her country. Through the work of peacebuilder Lucy Nusseibeh, she has been able to 
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&amp;v=e3NI2P7qFh4&amp;feature=emb_logo" target="_blank">tell her story.</a>
          <br><br>
          In Palestine, a place where there have been many years of conflict, peace can seem unattainable. Yet, there are those who have been working tirelessly to make a change for many years. Amongst those people is Lucy. As the founder and Executive Chair of 
          <a href="https://www.mendonline.org/" target="_blank">Middle East Nonviolence and Democracy (MEND)</a>, Lucy has been working in Palestine’s West Bank for over two decades. As we were filled with questions, we travelled down the road to Jerusalem paid her a visit.

        <h3>“Participants are trained both to film and be filmed. They become aware of their own image, through filming each other and themselves in discussions on different topics. So, it raises a lot of awareness, including self-awareness, which then empowers them to articulate better their own views and needs. This is one of the ways we have found really effective working with youth and women.”</h3>
