        <h3>Patrick Bwire grew up in Buboko, a poor, war-torn village in Uganda. Whilst the violent conflict had ended, chaos remained. As a child, Patrick was faced with violence, now he is changing the lives of many. <br>
          His weapon? Peacebuilding.

          Through our joint effort, CECORE helps young people to change their communities. Now, many young people in Karamoja, Northern Uganda, are moving away from violence and are developing the skills to provide for their families. As young leaders, they speak out against destructive ways and embrace dialogue for peace. And with much success: the young peace champions reconcile conflicting parties, support fellow youth and speak out against violence and practices like forced marriage.  Watch this video to see changes that are happening!

        <h3>Elzina, Elvira, Yusuf, Melis and Latifa are a few of the youth whose lives have changed as a result of the ‘Cameras in Hands’ project (our joint project with Foundation for Tolerance International. </h3>
        <p>Growing up in Kyrgyzstan, a country that is characterised by a pervasive potential for conflict, they felt excluded from society, as well as fatigue from traditional peacebuilding activities. They participated in our project ‘Cameras in Hands,’ specifically designed to tackle these issues and provide a platform for them to raise issues important to them. Through this project, in which they scripted, recorded and edited videos and showed them to their communities and policymakers, they became agents of change, and were able to bridge social, gender, and ethnic divides.</p><a class="red" href="#">Learn more about the project</a><br><a class="red" href="#">Learn more about the methodology &amp; project</a>
